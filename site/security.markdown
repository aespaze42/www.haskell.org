# Security

## Reporting security advisories

**If you want to submit a new, high-impact vulnerability**, or
would like Security Response Team assistance to coordinate a response, please mail
*security-advisories@haskell.org* with details instead of submitting a pull
request (PRs are public). Rule of thumb: a high-severity vulnerability
affecting the GHC toolchain or a popular library. If you think you might
have a high-impact vulnerability, please contact the Security Response Team and we will
help to assess the impact.

The [security-advisories database](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories)
is open for submissions. The submission process is detailed in
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
If something goes wrong or the steps are not sufficiently clear, that
is a bug; please let us know (e.g. create a GitHub issue).
